                    <h1><small>ABOUT</small></h1>
                    <p> Since 1919, The Daily Bruin has served as UCLA’s premier source of campus news for students and members of the university. The paper, originally known as Normal Outlook and then Cub Californian, has mostly published each school day of the year since the mid-1920s. The Bruin is now the only five-day paper serving a UC campus. </p>

                    <p id="caption"><i>Above: a picture of Joe and Josephine Bruin, disguised as Calvin and Hobbes in a moment of levity. We noted the fangs, the mandibles of death, and the ferocious gleam in their gazes as they eyed their next meal: Trojans. Asked to comment on the occasion, the Bruins simply roared in response.</i></p>

                    <p>In Kerckhoff 118, the Daily Bruin’s central-campus office, about 250 students work in 14 editorial sections to produce the paper each day. Students serve as the editors, the reporters, the designers and the programmers. An editorial board composed of UCLA students serves as the newspaper’s official voice on matters concerning students and the campus.</p>

                    <p> Because UCLA does not have a journalism major or school, the Daily Bruin serves as the university’s primary training ground for young journalists. Daily Bruin alumni have worked at many top news organizations, such as the National Public Radio, BBC, the New York Times and the Washington Post. </p>
