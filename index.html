                <h1>Daily Bruin</h1>
                <p> Since 1919, The Daily Bruin has served as UCLA’s premier source of campus news for students and members of the university. The paper, originally known as Normal Outlook and then Cub Californian, has mostly published each school day of the year since the mid-1920s. The Bruin is now the only five-day paper serving a University of California campus. </p>

                <p>Countless alumni from The Bruin have gone on to work for top daily newspapers and news organizations around the world. Bruin alumni have gone on to receive three Pulitzer Prizes and a Nobel Peace Prize.</p>

                <p>In Kerckhoff 118, the Daily Bruin’s central-campus office, about 250 students work in 14 editorial sections to produce the paper each day. Students serve as the paper’s editors, reporters, photographers, videojournalists, designers and programmers. An editorial board composed of UCLA students serves as the newspaper’s official voice on matters concerning students.</p>
